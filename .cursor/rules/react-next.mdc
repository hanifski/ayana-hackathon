- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Use interfaces over types
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Favor named exports for components.
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses.
